    "## If you're new to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",

    "I've written a notebook called [Guide to Jupyter](Guide%20to%20Jupyter.ipynb) to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using `!` to run shell commands, and `tqdm` to show progress.\n",

Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today.

      "Why AWS Elastic Beanstalk?\n",
      "AWS Elastic Beanstalk is the fastest way to get web applications up and running on AWS. You can simply upload your application code, and the service automatically handles details such as resource provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling, and monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk is ideal if you have a PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Node.js, .NET, Go, or Docker web application. Elastic Beanstalk uses core AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to easily support applications that need to scale to serve millions of users.\n",

      "Features\n",
      "Open all\n",
      "Wide selection of application platforms\n",
      "AWS Elastic Beanstalk supports web applications written in many popular languages and frameworks. It requires no or minimal code changes to go from development machine to the cloud. Development options for deploying your web applications include Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Python, Go, and Docker.\n",
      "Variety of application deployment options\n",
      "With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you can deploy your code through the AWS Management Console,\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface,\n",
      "Visual Studio\n",
      ", and\n",
      "Eclipse\n",
      ".¬†Multiple deployment policies‚Äîall at once, rolling, rolling with an additional batch, immutable, and blue/green‚Äîoffer choices for the speed and safety of deploying your applications while reducing the administrative burden.\n",
      "Monitoring\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk provides a unified user interface (UI) to monitor and manage the health of your applications.\n",
      "Application Health\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk collects 40+ key metrics and attributes to determine the health of your applications. With the Elastic Beanstalk Health Dashboard, you can visualize overall application health and customize application health checks, health permissions, and health reporting in one UI.\n",
      "Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk integration with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray means you can use\n",
      "monitoring dashboards\n",
      "to view key performance metrics such as latency, CPU utilization, and response codes. You can also set up CloudWatch alarms to get notified when metrics exceed your chosen thresholds.\n",
      "Updates and management\n",
      "You can choose to automatically get the latest platform versions of your Elastic Beanstalk environment and new patches using\n",
      "managed platform updates\n",
      ". An\n",

      "Scaling\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk uses Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling to automatically scale your application in and out based on its specific needs. Multiple availability zones give you an option to improve application reliability and availability.\n",
      "Customization\n",
      "With Elastic Beanstalk, you have the freedom to select the AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instance type including Spot instances, that are optimal for your application. You also retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application. If you decide you want to take over some (or all) of the elements of your infrastructure, you can do so seamlessly by using Elastic Beanstalk's management capabilities.\n",
      "Compliance\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk meets the criteria for ISO, PCI, SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 compliance along with the criteria for HIPAA eligibility. This means applications running on Elastic Beanstalk can process regulated financial data or protected health information (PHI).\n",
      "AWS Graviton support\n",

      "Why AWS Elastic Beanstalk?\n",
      "AWS Elastic Beanstalk is the fastest way to get web applications up and running on AWS. You can simply upload your application code, and the service automatically handles details such as resource provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling, and monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk is ideal if you have a PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Node.js, .NET, Go, or Docker web application. Elastic Beanstalk uses core AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to easily support applications that need to scale to serve millions of users.\n",

      "Wide selection of application platforms\n",
      "AWS Elastic Beanstalk supports web applications written in many popular languages and frameworks. It requires no or minimal code changes to go from development machine to the cloud. Development options for deploying your web applications include Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Python, Go, and Docker.\n",
      "Variety of application deployment options\n",
      "With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you can deploy your code through the AWS Management Console,\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface,\n",
      "Visual Studio\n",
      ", and\n",
      "Eclipse\n",
      ".¬†Multiple deployment policies‚Äîall at once, rolling, rolling with an additional batch, immutable, and blue/green‚Äîoffer choices for the speed and safety of deploying your applications while reducing the administrative burden.\n",
      "Monitoring\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk provides a unified user interface (UI) to monitor and manage the health of your applications.\n",
      "Application Health\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk collects 40+ key metrics and attributes to determine the health of your applications. With the Elastic Beanstalk Health Dashboard, you can visualize overall application health and customize application health checks, health permissions, and health reporting in one UI.\n",
      "Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk integration with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray means you can use\n",

      "Customization\n",
      "With Elastic Beanstalk, you have the freedom to select the AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instance type including Spot instances, that are optimal for your application. You also retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application. If you decide you want to take over some (or all) of the elements of your infrastructure, you can do so seamlessly by using Elastic Beanstalk's management capabilities.\n",
      "Compliance\n",
      "Elastic Beanstalk meets the criteria for ISO, PCI, SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 compliance along with the criteria for HIPAA eligibility. This means applications running on Elastic Beanstalk can process regulated financial data or protected health information (PHI).\n",
